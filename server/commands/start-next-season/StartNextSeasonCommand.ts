 * them — then starts the next one from the commissioner's draft: who's in,
 * the team line-up (kept franchises, new teams, deleted teams) and any rule
 * changes. The league moves onto the admins' next motorsport season, or waits
 * for it if it isn't set up yet. Commissioner-only. Unprefixed — spans many repositories.
